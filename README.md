# Web-Browser-Based-Flash-Card-Trainer
This project showcases how integrating a Large Language Model (LLaMA 2) enhances traditional flashcard-based vocabulary training. Instead of relying on a static database, the app uses few-shot prompt engineering to dynamically generate German words, provide smart English hints, and evaluate user responses with contextual understanding—even forgiving minor spelling errors or missing articles. By embedding an LLM, the app becomes more adaptive, scalable, and intelligent—demonstrating the practical value of generative AI in personalized language learning.

# Web-Browser-Based-Flash-Card-Trainer
LLM-Powered German-English Flashcard App
This application is an intelligent vocabulary training tool that helps users improve their German-to-English language skills in an interactive way. A key innovation in this app is the integration of LLaMA 2, an open-source Large Language Model (LLM), using few-shot prompt engineering. This replaces the need for a static flashcard database.

**Description**
The app dynamically generates German words using LLaMA 2 instead of relying on pre-saved cards. Users are prompted to enter the English translation. If needed, the model provides a short hint in English. When the user submits their answer, the model verifies its correctness, allowing for small spelling errors and missing articles.

**Features**
1. Dynamic generation of German words using a language model

2. Real-time English hint generation for each word

3. Smart answer verification that tolerates minor spelling mistakes

4. Score tracking and session-based history

5. Login and signup functionality with user authentication

6. Integrated timer and session controls (start, stop, restart)

**Importance of LLM Integration**
Integrating a language model into a flashcard app allows for greater flexibility, intelligence, and adaptability. Unlike traditional flashcard systems that rely on fixed datasets, this app generates fresh content on the fly, making the experience more engaging and less repetitive. The use of few-shot prompt engineering enables the model to operate effectively without the need for full-scale fine-tuning, making it efficient and scalable.
